# Inverting the Venture Model

it’s customary to state the fact that 9/10 of startups fail. This is primarily driven by the need for startups to get really big to satisfy venture math [link to eunice’s post]. To have a chance of becoming a unicorn (valued at $1B) investors have to agree with your vision and see a path to $100 million annual run rate within the next 5-7 years.

That’s a very narrow way of defining success. No wonder there’s so much “failure” in the process.

# Levels of (Fiscal) Success

people need breathing room financially to be able to afford to take risks

- that goes for everything from learning new skills to starting a business
- you can’t explore freely when you’re in survival mode

emergency savings - $10k

rent for a year - $25k

home down payment - $75k

college for one child - $150k

retirement nest egg (35 year old) - $300k
